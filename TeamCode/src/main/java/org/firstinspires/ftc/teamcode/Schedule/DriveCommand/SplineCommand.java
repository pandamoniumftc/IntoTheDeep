        TODO:
        - make command that follows spline, similar format and algorithm as PositionCommand
        - calculate centripetal force given velocity, some constant mass of robot, and radius calculated at a specific point
        - convert centripetal force to a vector that adds on to the translational correction vector
        - maybe integrate motion profiling instead of hardcoding the t values? (both spline and position commands), refer to MotionProfile class on how to implement it
        - if done, ask me if there is anything else to add (if I think of something else or if I forget something)
